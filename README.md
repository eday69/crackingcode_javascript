Cracking the Coding Interview book examples in Javascript
PS. Examples in html, but function is coded in javascript.

isPalindromePermutation.html:
    Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation
    of a palindrome (word/phrase that is the same forwards and backwards)

oneAway.html:
    Given two string, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero
    edits) away. Edits: insert a character, remove a character or replace a 
    character.

rotateMatrix.html:
    Given an image represented by NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image
    is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degress

stringCompression.html:
    Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the
    counts of repeated characters.

stringRotation.html:
    Assume you have a method isSubtring which checks if one word
    is a substring of another. Given two string, s1 and s2, write
    code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call
    to isSubstring (e.g. "waterbottle" is a rotation of "erbottlewat")

zeroMatrix.html
    Write an algorithm such that if an element in a MxN matrix is 0, its
    entire tow and column are set to 0.
